things I learned 

- private members are not really private at all if you know their memory location (which turns out to be right next to the public ones)
- VirtualProtect works but is weird
- there is no (easy) way to somehow "catch" a seg fault. It will end your program
- it is possible to share memory between processes using boost::interprocess
- compilers are really good at optimising code to hide cache misses
- how to call other executables 


Conclusion:
Computers are weird and I love it.
